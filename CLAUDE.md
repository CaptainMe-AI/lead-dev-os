# CLAUDE.md

Dev instructions for the lead-dev-os repository itself.

## Project

lead-dev-os is a spec & context-driven framework for Claude Code development on large projects. It provides structured skills for product planning, spec writing, task scoping, and context-aware implementation. Distributed as a Claude Code plugin.

## Terminology

- **target project** — the project where `lead-dev-os` plugin is used
- **spec** — a feature specification
- **task** — a task to be executed by the AI agent
- **plugin** — the `lead-dev-os/` directory containing `.claude-plugin/` and `skills/`

## Key Conventions

- `lead-dev-os/` is the plugin directory — this is what users point `--plugin-dir` at
- Skills are flat under `lead-dev-os/skills/` (no strategic/tactical nesting — plugin requirement)
- All skill cross-references use the `/lead-dev-os:` namespace (e.g., `/lead-dev-os:step1-write-spec`)
- Standards files are bundled inside `lead-dev-os/skills/init/` (no separate content/ directory)
- Templates are co-located with their skills (e.g., `step1-write-spec/template.md`)
- Specs go into `specs/` directory in the target project
- No `config.yml` in the plugin — stack selection is handled interactively by `/lead-dev-os:init`
- `app/` and `scripts/` are deprecated but still functional for backwards compatibility

## Workflow (3 steps)

1. `/lead-dev-os:step1-write-spec` — Interactive Q&A to gather requirements, then formalize into structured spec
2. `/lead-dev-os:step2-scope-tasks` — Break into task groups with explicit context directives
3. `/lead-dev-os:step3-implement-tasks` — Context-aware execution of task groups

## Context Philosophy

Concept files (`agents-context/concepts/`) are general guidance, not code:
- Describe approaches, conventions, and decision rationale
- Reference file paths instead of duplicating code
- Each file covers one concept/feature domain
- Composable — load only what's needed for the current task
