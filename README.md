`agents-flight-deck` is a spec & context-aware framework for Claude Code development on large projects. It provides structured commands for product planning, spec writing, task scoping, and context-aware implementation.
The context of the project is stored under `agents-context/` directory, it is domain specific and an agents is provided only the context it needs to perform its task.

Think about it as a lead developer's main tool for guiding a team of AI agents in a project.
When a Lead Developer has a team of engineers, their responsobilitiy is to guide them in the right direction. The Lead developer needs to explain the specific context and domain knowledge for the spec at hand only.

See [Recomendations for Development with `agents-flight-deck`](#recomendations-for-development-with-agents-flight-deck) for more details.

## Key Principles & Concepts 

### Spec-Driven Development
- Spec is the contract, code follows
- Requirements before implementation, always
- Agents execute against testable acceptance criteria
- Eliminates ambiguity-driven rework
- Inspirations from [agent-os](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) for spec-driven development, file organization and thourough prompting

### Context-aware Implementation
- **Composable** — Load only what you need for the current task
- **Self-referencing** — Concepts link to related concepts
- **Version-controlled** — Track evolution of ideas over time
- **AI-friendly** — Agents load specific concepts as context before working
- Inspirations from [agor](https://github.com/preset-io/agor) for organizing the context

### PARA for AI Agents
- [PARA method from Tiego Forte](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)


## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
- A git repository for your target project

### Install into a project

Clone this repo somewhere on your machine, then run the install script from inside your target project:

```bash
# Clone agents-flight-deck (one-time)
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agents-flight-deck.git ~/agents-flight-deck

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your-project

# Run the installer
~/agents-flight-deck/scripts/install.sh
```

### Installer options

```bash
# Full install (commands + context + templates)
~/agents-flight-deck/scripts/install.sh

# Update commands only (preserves your context and standards)
~/agents-flight-deck/scripts/install.sh --commands-only

# Verbose output for debugging
~/agents-flight-deck/scripts/install.sh --verbose
```

The installer is idempotent — safe to re-run. It will:
- Overwrite commands, templates, and guides (framework-managed files)
- Preserve your `agents-context/concepts/` and `agents-context/standards/` content
- Append to your existing `CLAUDE.md` without duplicating if the section already exists

## 🗂️ What gets installed

After running `install.sh` in your project, you'll have:

### What each directory does

| Directory | Purpose | Managed by |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `.claude/commands/agents-flight-deck/` | Slash commands that appear in Claude Code | Installer (overwritten on update) |
| `agents-context/concepts/` | Project-specific domain knowledge and general guidance | You + commands + implementation |
| `agents-context/standards/` | Coding standards, conventions, architecture patterns | `/define-standards` command |
| `agents-context/guides/` | Workflow documentation | Installer (overwritten on update) |
| `agents-flight-deck/templates/` | Reusable document templates for specs and tasks | Installer (overwritten on update) |
| `agents-flight-deck/specs/` | Dated spec folders created by the tactical workflow | `/step1-shape-spec` and subsequent steps |

### Spec folder structure

Each feature produces a dated folder in `agents-flight-deck/specs/`:

```
agents-flight-deck/specs/
└── 2026-02-25-user-auth/
    ├── planning/
    │   ├── initialization.md       # Raw idea captured in Step 1
    │   └── requirements.md         # Structured Q&A from Step 1
    ├── spec.md                     # Formal specification from Step 2
    └── tasks.md                    # Context-aware task groups from Step 3
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🧭 Getting started (new project)

Run the strategic commands once to establish your project foundation:

```
/plan-product          → Defines mission, vision, users, tech stack
/define-standards      → Establishes coding style, architecture, testing conventions
/plan-roadmap          → Creates prioritized feature roadmap with phases
```

### 🔨 Building a feature

Run the tactical commands sequentially for each feature:

```
/step1-shape-spec      → Interactive Q&A to gather requirements
/step2-define-spec     → Formalize into spec with numbered requirements (FR-###)
/step3-scope-tasks     → Break into task groups with context directives
/step4-implement-tasks → Context-aware implementation of task groups
```

### Updating commands

When agents-flight-deck releases new command versions, update without touching your project's context:

```bash
~/agents-flight-deck/scripts/install.sh --commands-only
```

## 🧪 Testing

Tests live in `tests/` and cover both unit and integration behavior of the install script.

### Run all tests

```bash
./tests/test_common_functions.sh && ./tests/test_install_creates.sh && ./tests/test_install_overwrites.sh
```

### Individual test suites

| Suite | File | What it tests |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Unit | `tests/test_common_functions.sh` | `ensure_dir`, `ensure_gitkeep`, `copy_if_not_exists`, `copy_with_warning`, `print_verbose` |
| Integration: creates | `tests/test_install_creates.sh` | Fresh install produces all expected files, `--commands-only` flag, append to existing CLAUDE.md, install without .git |
| Integration: overwrites | `tests/test_install_overwrites.sh` | Re-install overwrites commands/templates/guides, preserves concepts/standards/specs/CLAUDE.md, `--commands-only` only touches commands |

Each test suite creates a temporary directory, runs `install.sh` against it, asserts outcomes, and cleans up. No side effects on your working directory.
