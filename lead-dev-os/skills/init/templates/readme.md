# {Project Name} Context

This directory contains modular knowledge files that document {Project Name}'s concepts, architecture, and design principles. These files are designed to be:

- **Composable** - Load only what you need
- **Self-referencing** - Concepts link to related concepts
- **Version-controlled** - Track evolution of ideas over time
- **AI-friendly** - Agents can load specific concepts as context

## Available Concepts

> This section is populated as you build your project. Add entries here when creating new concept files.

### Core Concepts

<!-- Uncomment and adapt as you create files:
- **[architecture.md](concepts/architecture.md)** - System design, tech stack, data flow, service layer patterns
- **[models.md](concepts/models.md)** - Data models, relationships, factories
- **[auth.md](concepts/auth.md)** - Authentication and authorization patterns
-->

### Domain Concepts

<!-- Uncomment and adapt as you create files:
- **[api.md](concepts/api.md)** - REST API structure, endpoints, request/response formats, error handling
- **[frontend.md](concepts/frontend.md)** - Frontend architecture, component patterns, styling
- **[testing.md](concepts/testing.md)** - Testing framework, conventions, fixture patterns
- **[infrastructure.md](concepts/infrastructure.md)** - Deployment, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure
-->

## Development Standards

Each concept file links to relevant standards in `agents-context/standards/`. These standards define best practices that must be followed:

| Category | Standards |
|----------|-----------|
| **Global** | [coding-style.md](standards/coding-style.md), [commenting.md](standards/commenting.md), [conventions.md](standards/conventions.md), [error-handling.md](standards/error-handling.md), [validation.md](standards/validation.md) |
| **Testing** | [test-writing.md](standards/test-writing.md) |

> Add rows to this table as new standards files are created via `/lead-dev-os:define-standards`.

## Using Context Files

### For Developers

Read concept files to understand specific aspects of your project:

```bash
# Start with core concepts
cat agents-context/concepts/architecture.md

# Then explore specific areas
cat agents-context/concepts/models.md
cat agents-context/concepts/auth.md
```

### For AI Agents

Load relevant concepts based on your task:

<!-- Update this mapping as you create concept files:
- **Adding API endpoint** → `api.md`, `auth.md`
- **Adding UI feature** → `frontend.md`, `frontend-components.md`
- **Writing tests** → `testing.md`
- **Deploying changes** → `infrastructure.md`
-->

Task groups generated by `/lead-dev-os:step2-scope-tasks` automatically include **"Read before starting"** directives that list exactly which concept and standard files to load.

## Contributing

When adding new concepts:

1. Create focused, single-topic files (prefer smaller over larger)
2. Use wiki-style links to reference related concepts: `[[concept-name]]`
3. Include a "Related:" section at the top
4. Add an entry to this README under the appropriate section
5. Update cross-references in existing concepts
6. Update AGENTS.md Context Documentation Index
7. Adding code samples:
   7.1. yes: best practices
   7.2. yes: generalized patterns
   7.3. no: code that exists in source files — reference the source file path instead

When modifying existing concepts:

1. Update relevant sections
2. Update cross-references in related concepts
3. Update this README if the scope of the concept changed
4. Adding code samples:
   4.1. yes: best practices
   4.2. yes: generalized patterns
   4.3. no: code that exists in source files — reference the source file path instead

## Philosophy

> "Context engineering isn't about prompt templates — it's about managing modular knowledge as first-class composable primitives."

These concept files allow agents to fetch only the knowledge they need, keeping context windows efficient while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
