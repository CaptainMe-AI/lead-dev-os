# Agents Context

This directory contains modular knowledge files that document your project's concepts, architecture, and design principles. These files are designed to be:

- **Composable** — Load only what you need for the current task
- **Self-referencing** — Concepts link to related concepts
- **Version-controlled** — Track evolution of ideas over time
- **AI-friendly** — Agents load specific concepts as context before working

## Available Concepts

> This section is populated as you build your project. Add entries here when creating new concept files.

### Core Concepts

<!-- Example entries (uncomment and adapt as you create files):
- **[architecture.md](concepts/architecture.md)** — System design, tech stack, data flow, service layer patterns
- **[models.md](concepts/models.md)** — Data models, relationships, factories
- **[auth.md](concepts/auth.md)** — Authentication and authorization patterns
-->

### Domain Concepts

<!-- Example entries (uncomment and adapt as you create files):
- **[api.md](concepts/api.md)** — REST API structure, endpoints, request/response formats, error handling
- **[frontend.md](concepts/frontend.md)** — Frontend architecture, component patterns, styling
- **[testing.md](concepts/testing.md)** — Testing framework, conventions, fixture patterns
- **[infrastructure.md](concepts/infrastructure.md)** — Deployment, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure
- **[background-jobs.md](concepts/background-jobs.md)** — Job processing, queues, retry strategy
-->

## Development Standards

Concept files link to relevant standards in `agents-context/standards/`. These standards define conventions that must be followed:

| Category | Standards |
|----------|-----------|
| **Coding Style** | `standards/coding-style.md` |
| **Architecture** | `standards/architecture.md` |
| **Testing** | `standards/testing.md` |

> Standards are created by running `/define-standards`. Add rows to this table as new standards files are created.

## Using Context Files

### For Developers

Read concept files to understand specific aspects of your project:

```bash
# Start with core concepts
cat agents-context/concepts/architecture.md

# Then explore specific areas
cat agents-context/concepts/models.md
cat agents-context/concepts/auth.md
```

### For AI Agents

Load relevant concepts based on your task:

<!-- Example mappings (update as you create concept files):
- **Adding API endpoint** → `api.md`, `auth.md`
- **Adding UI feature** → `frontend.md`, `frontend-components.md`
- **Writing tests** → `testing.md`
- **Deploying changes** → `infrastructure.md`
- **Background processing** → `background-jobs.md`
-->

Task groups generated by `/step3-scope-tasks` automatically include **"Read before starting"** directives that list exactly which concept and standard files to load.

## Contributing

When adding new concepts:

1. Create focused, single-topic files (prefer smaller over larger)
2. Use wiki-style links to reference related concepts: `[[concept-name]]`
3. Include a "Related:" section at the top
4. Add an entry to this README under the appropriate section
5. Update cross-references in existing concepts
6. Adding code samples:
   - Yes: best practices and generalized patterns
   - No: code that exists in source files — reference the source file path instead

When modifying existing concepts:

1. Update relevant sections
2. Update cross-references in related concepts
3. Update this README if the scope of the concept changed
4. Same code sample rules as above

## Philosophy

> "Context engineering isn't about prompt templates — it's about managing modular knowledge as first-class composable primitives."

Concept files allow agents to fetch only the knowledge they need, keeping context windows efficient while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
